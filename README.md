  Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)

## Introduction

As we adapt and evolve as a species, automation is a large part of this change that we experience that allows us to grow technically, and also opens up a new depth to our problem solving capabilites. Automation has the ability to help us maintain discipline, make decisions, and provide advice, along with many other benefits. This project attempts to take automation to the next level within the medical field in providing diagnoses to patients experiencing symptons of pneumonia. The aim of this project is to create a binary classification model that inputs an image of a chest x-ray and outputs a diagnosis of whether or not the inidividual has pneumonia. 

### Background & Problem Statement

In detecting pneumonia in patients, the typical procedure is to listen to the patient's lungs using a stethoscope to observe any abnormalities, hypothesizing a visual diagnosis of a patient's chest x-ray, and if necessary for a clearer diagnosis, using a blood test to confirm the presence of the infection.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:** Create a model that can accurately detect the presence of a pnemonia infection given an image of a patient's chest x-ray.
