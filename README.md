## Introduction

As we adapt and evolve as a species, automation is a large part of this change that we experience that allows us to grow technically, and also opens up a new depth to our problem solving capabilites. Automation has the ability to help us maintain discipline, make decisions, and provide advice, along with many other benefits. This project attempts to take automation to the next level within the medical field in providing diagnoses to patients experiencing symptons of pneumonia. The aim of this project is to create a binary classification model that inputs an image of a chest x-ray and outputs a diagnosis of whether or not the inidividual has pneumonia. 

## Background & Problem Statement

In detecting pneumonia in patients, the typical procedure is to listen to the patient's lungs using a stethoscope to observe any abnormalities, hypothesizing a visual diagnosis of a patient's chest x-ray, and if necessary for a clearer diagnosis, using a blood test to confirm the presence of the infection.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:** Create a model that can accurately detect the presence of a pnemonia infection given an image of a patient's chest x-ray.

## Data

[Click here for Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

The data used for this project was sourced from a Kaggle.com competition. It includes 5,216 images for training, 624 images for testing, and 16 images for validation.

Among the 5216 images for TRAINING, there were 1,341 images of NORMAL lungs while there were 3,875 images of lungs with PNEUMONIA.

Among the 624 images for TESTING, there were 233 images of NORMAL lungs while there were 389 images of lungs with PNEUMONIA.

The validation set was split 50-50 between NORMAL and PNEUMONIA. 8 NORMAL images and 8 PNEUMONIA images.

## Modeling & Analysis
The approach in modeling was to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is because CNNs are adept at image recognition because of their application of the convolution and pooling layers which work together to turn an image into an array of information represent the patterns and colors that occur within a given image.

The aim in modeling was to construct a model which will iterate over the NORMAL and PNEUMONIA training images to learn the differences between an instance of NORMAL lungs vs. and instance of PNEUMONIA lungs.
